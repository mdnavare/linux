/**
 * DOC: Display Refresh Rate Switching (DRRS)
 *
 * Display Refresh Rate Switching (DRRS) is a power conservation feature
 * which enables swtching between low and high refresh rates,
 * dynamically, based on the usage scenario. This feature is applicable
 * for internal panels.
 *
 * Indication that the panel supports DRRS is given by the panel EDID, which
 * would list multiple refresh rates for one resolution.
 *
 * DRRS is of 2 types - static and seamless.
 * Static DRRS involves changing refresh rate (RR) by doing a full modeset
 * (may appear as a blink on screen) and is used in dock-undock scenario.
 * Seamless DRRS involves changing RR without any visual effect to the user
 * and can be used during normal system usage. This is done by programming
 * certain registers.
 *
 * Support for static/seamless DRRS may be indicated in the VBT based on
 * inputs from the panel spec.
 *
 * DRRS saves power by switching to low RR based on usage scenarios.
 *
 * eDP DRRS:-
 *        The implementation is based on frontbuffer tracking implementation.
 * When there is a disturbance on the screen triggered by user activity or a
 * periodic system activity, DRRS is disabled (RR is changed to high RR).
 * When there is no movement on screen, after a timeout of 1 second, a switch
 * to low RR is made.
 *        For integration with frontbuffer tracking code,
 * intel_drrs_invalidate() and intel_drrs_flush() are called.
 *
 * DRRS can be further extended to support other internal panels and also
 * the scenario of video playback wherein RR is set based on the rate
 * requested by userspace.

 * one frequency to another. Switches can be between high and low RR
 * supported by the panel or to any other RR based on media playback (in

 *
 * The caller of this function needs to take a lock on dev_priv->drrs.
